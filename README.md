# to-do_notes windows forms
A to-do and notes windows forms application which I used as a course work in data structures and algorithms.
- **Task Management:** The application allows users to add, view, toggle the status (Pending/Completed), and delete tasks.
- **Note Taking:** Users can associate notes with each task and save them.
- **Mark for Deletion:** It includes a feature to mark tasks for deletion using a checkbox and then delete all marked tasks at once.
- **Display:**
    - Tasks are displayed in a `ListBox` (`taskDisplay`) showing the task name and its status.
    - Details (status and notes) of the selected task are shown in separate labels (`statusLabel`) and a `TextBox` (`notesInput`).
    - All notes for all tasks are displayed in a `TextBox` (`allNotesDisplay`).
    - The current UTC time and a hardcoded username are displayed.
- **Hover Effect:** Buttons have a simple hover effect that changes their background color.

**Key Code Elements and Concepts:**

- **`Form1` Class:** This is the main form of the application, containing all the UI elements and the logic behind them.
- **Data Structures:**
    - `_tasks (Dictionary<string, TaskItem>)`: Stores tasks. The task name (string) is the key, and a `TaskItem` object holds the status and notes. This allows for quick lookups of tasks by name.
    - `_taskList (List<string>)`: Maintains the order in which tasks were added. This is important for displaying tasks in the `taskDisplay` in the correct sequence.
    - `_markedTasks (HashSet<string>)`: Keeps track of the names of tasks that the user has marked for deletion. `HashSet` is efficient for checking if a task is marked.
- **`TaskItem` Class:** A simple class to represent a single task, holding its `Status` (string) and `Notes` (string).
- **Event Handlers:** The code uses event handlers (methods that respond to user actions or events) for various UI elements:
    - `addButton_Click`: Handles adding a new task.
    - `saveNotesButton_Click`: Handles saving notes for the selected task.
    - `toggleStatusButton_Click`: Handles changing the status of the selected task.
    - `taskDisplay_SelectedIndexChanged`: Handles updating the details display when a different task is selected in the `ListBox`.
    - `deleteButton_Click`: Handles deleting the currently selected task.
    - `markCheckBox_CheckedChanged`: Handles marking or unmarking a task for deletion.
    - `deleteMarkedButton_Click`: Handles deleting all tasks that are marked.
    - `Button_MouseEnter` and `Button_MouseLeave`: Handle the button hover effect.
- **`Timer`:** A `System.Windows.Forms.Timer` is used to update the `dateTimeLabel` every second, displaying the current UTC time.
- **`InitializeComponent()`:** This method (generated by the Visual Studio designer) initializes all the controls on the form.
- **`InitializeEvents()`:** This method is currently empty. It was likely intended to be used for programmatically attaching event handlers, but in this code, they are likely attached in the Visual Studio designer.
- **`UpdateTaskDisplay()`:** This method refreshes the `taskDisplay` `ListBox` with the current tasks and their statuses from the `_tasks` dictionary, maintaining the order from `_taskList`.
- **`UpdateSelectedTaskDetails()`:** This method updates the `statusLabel` and `notesInput` based on the currently selected task in the `taskDisplay`.
- **`UpdateAllNotesDisplay()`:** This method updates the `allNotesDisplay` `TextBox` with the notes of all tasks that have notes.
- **`GetSelectedTask()`:** A helper method to extract the task name from the `SelectedItem` of the `taskDisplay` `ListBox`.
- **`OnFormClosing()`:** This override of a form event ensures that the `timer` is stopped and disposed of when the form is closed, preventing potential resource leaks.
